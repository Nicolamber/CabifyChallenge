# CabifyChallenge

## Description
This exercise was entirely performed using Kotlin as the programming language, focused on a use case and MVVM architecture.
The views were developed in XML with the concept of view binding.

The flow is responsible for displaying a list of products to the user, which may or may not have associated discounts and can also 
be of different types. Once the user adds the desired products, the application will take them to a checkout that will inform them of the total amounts,
including discounts, and provide the option to make the payment.
